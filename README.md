# LineGuide

**The actor's scene partner in your pocket.**

LineGuide is a Flutter app (iOS, Android, and watchOS companion) that helps actors learn their lines by running through scenes with real cast recordings or high-quality on-device text-to-speech. A production organizer uploads a script PDF, assigns roles to cast members, and everyone records their lines. Then any actor can rehearse their scenes — hearing other characters speak and delivering their own lines, with the app listening via on-device speech recognition to advance automatically.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Production
An organizer creates a new production, uploads the script as a PDF, and the app uses on-device OCR to extract the text. The raw text is parsed into a structured script — a sequence of labeled lines (character name + dialogue) and stage directions.

### 2. Edit & Validate the Script
The organizer reviews the parsed script in a highlighted editor showing each character's lines in distinct colors. They fix any OCR errors, adjust character names, and split/merge lines as needed. Built-in validation checks for:
- A complete cast list extracted from the script
- Every line attributed to a known character
- Scene/act boundaries properly marked

### 3. Assign Roles & Invite Cast
Once the script looks right, the organizer sees the full cast list and assigns a **primary** and **understudy** for each role. Invitations go out via email or SMS with a deep link. Cast members open the app and land directly on their assigned production with their suggested role(s).

### 4. Record Lines
Each cast member records their character's lines one at a time. The app shows the line text, records audio, and lets them re-record until satisfied. Recordings are synced to all cast members via cloud storage.

### 5. Rehearse Scenes
This is the core experience. An actor selects a scene to rehearse:
- Other characters' lines play back using **real cast recordings** (preferred) or **on-device TTS** (fallback for unrecorded lines)
- When it's the actor's turn, the app listens via **on-device speech recognition** (Whisper-based)
- The app matches what the actor says against the expected line and advances when they've delivered it
- **Jump back**: A configurable gesture (shake, double-tap, swipe) or a chosen keyword lets the actor jump back N lines (configurable) to retry a section
- Lines are highlighted as they progress through the scene
- Accuracy feedback shows how close they were to the written line

### 6. Watch Companion (Future)
A watchOS/wearOS companion app provides:
- Tap to jump back N lines
- Haptic cue when it's your turn to speak
- Basic transport controls (pause, restart scene)

### On-Device Models
| Purpose | Model | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Text-to-Speech** | Kokoro (via flutter_kokoro_tts or ONNX runtime) | High-quality, expressive, runs fully offline, multiple voices |
| **Speech-to-Text** | Whisper.cpp (via whisper_flutter_plus) | Accurate, runs on-device, supports streaming |
| **OCR** | ML Kit / Google Vision (placeholder) | Good baseline; swappable for Gemini later |

### Backend (Lightweight)
- **Supabase** for auth, invitations, production metadata, and audio file storage
- Postgres with Row Level Security so cast members only see their productions
- Supabase Storage for audio recordings with per-production buckets
- Realtime subscriptions for recording availability updates
